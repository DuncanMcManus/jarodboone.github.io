                        <h2> A Short Self Indulgent Monologue on Data and the Universe </h2>
                        <p> Ok so get this, the universe operates in an infinitely nested set of relationships, an unending waltz of energy
                        and time in 3 dimensional space that recursively defines our world and us. Data is a glimpse of that dance, a quick peek
                        at one of the infinite contracts that defines a nutty and complicated existence. Whether it’s a relationship in space, time,
                        or number of beans eaten in an hour, every set of data has something to say about how the world works. Even those funny graphs
                        showing correlations between completely “unrelated” data still obey the dance on some level -- these are just attributes
                        that are synchronized in some domain by a system so complex and interrelated it is beyond our comprehension and probably
                        not super useful to us (that being said, I still get a good chuckle from seeing the similarity between divorce rates in Maine
                        and per capita consumption of Margarine). </p>
                        <p> Surprisingly enough, trying to keep track of or understand infinite interconnected seldom-discrete relationships isn't easy.
                        The observable universe is saturated with data and trying to parse it is probably the oldest and most persistent battle in
                        human history. There's just too much shit man. In the information age, we have the ability to process and apprehend these relationships much further than
                        the efforts of our computerless ancestors. Rather than trying to brute force a set of data or observations with sheer attention
                        and time (and the occasional stroke of genius), we now have the means to intelligently manipulate and present data in a way
                        that more clearly demonstrates that data’s statement on the universe. </p>
                        <p> Through computer graphics we can process and display reality in ways that enable us to recognize trends and patterns (essences,
                        if you will) of these relationships. We can transform observation into insight within a transcendent visual language that
                        is intuitive and easy to communicate. Our scientific, economic, and mathematical research can be understood at new levels.
                        The innate rhetoric of scale, depth, color, and other aspects of the visual world; communicate ideas on a level that is much
                        closer to our biological hardware. </p>
                        <p> I want to work with data visualization because the most effective foundation of understanding is visualization. Data visualization
                        has and will continue to change everything about the spread of ideas from classroom to conference to research lab. I have
                        come to suspect that smarter data visualization methods and software is the key to moving forward in understanding and uniting
                        our universal model. By presenting data in a particular way we are able to view a reality through a different lens, we gain
                        a new perspective and new truths of the same reality. Working in data visualization involves stripping data to a more intuitive
                        core and abnormal translation of information. Thanks to my introduction to the world of computer science and fantastic books
                        like “Gӧdel, Escher, Bach”, I’ve fallen in love with information theory and to coalesce that with a research pertinent purpose
                        and the wizardry of computer graphics would be a dream come true. As an added bonus, I think that understanding the link
                        between euclidean geometries and understanding of data is going to be instrumental in AI development. </p>
